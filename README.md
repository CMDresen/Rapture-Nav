# Rapture-Nav
A world map-tracking program I created to assist with running an experimental, roadtrip-based TTRPG I was developing.

Refer to raptureNav/README.txt (the README within the initial folder) for information on how to use. There are two READMEs because this is my first time uploading to github! And I made a mistake because I'm a human man.
