# Rapture-Nav
A world map-tracking program I created to assist with running an experimental, roadtrip-based TTRPG I was developing.

Refer to raptureNav/README.txt (the README within the initial folder) for information on how to use. There are two READMEs because this is my first time uploading to github! And I made a mistake because I'm a human man.

![If you're wondering: Spooky America was one of the testing names for the TTRPG I made this tool for.](https://github.com/CMDresen/Rapture-Nav/blob/f8e8cc98d204fe498225a8fe411bd4f25f2cf641/raptureNav/images/Screenshot%202025-02-22%20234426.png)
